# PackageDelivery

## Summary
A mobile application that automatically sorts package delivery routes for you in the order given by you or a predefined list.
It will show the stops you have to make in order.

## Goal of this project
Replacing route-lists currently being used at work.

## Reason for the route-lists
The reason we need the lists is simple.
We get the routes on a handheld computer, but they're not totally in order.
In order to make sure we drive the route in the most efficient/easy way,
we write all the stops we have to make on the list, which is in order.


## Problems of the route-lists
At the moment, we have lists looking like this. 
| #     | first letter pc          | Street & numbers                   | Blank space for street numbers
| :-    | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-
| 1     | P                        | Holastreet 1-9 2-20                |
| 2     | C                        | Lawnway road                       |
| 3     | P                        | Holastreet 11-51 22-30             |
| ...   | ...                      | ...                                |
| 154   | ...                      | ...                                | 

They are sealed with plastic and we write on them with whiteboard markers.
* When they need to be changed, the list needs to be reprinted and resealed.
* When someone else needs the list, they have to find the list or the list needs to be printed out again.
* It takes time filling the list, because you have to look for the right place to put a street number.
* They get worn out or black from the markers, so they have to be replaced at some point.
* Cleaning the lists isn't super easy, and takes time too.

## Benefits of this project
* Everyone can have all the routes they want in their pocket.
* It's environment-friendly, because it saves paper, ink and plastic.
* It saves time, because writing the list manually takes time searching the list.
