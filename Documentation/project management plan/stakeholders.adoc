## The delivery people
These are the most important stakeholders.
They will use the app the whole day.

### Representative
Rick van Schijndel

## The boss
He wants everyone to be able to do their work good and fast.
The app can help with that.

## The supervisor
The guy that needs to make sure the route lists are available at all times.
He will be very happy if everyone has all the lists on the go.
